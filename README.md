This guide will show you how to setup Iris, Iris is a client used to access Nostr and its relays. 

This is by far the easiest thing to configure. 

Clone this repo https://github.com/irislib/iris-messenger and extract it so you have a folder named "iris-messenger".

Then use the sample docker-compose.yaml one level up in the directory. 

Run "docker-compose build" and "docker-compose up -d" 

The only other things you will need is certs and nginx attached is an nginx config file to get started.
